    "**What is model selection?**\n",
    "Model selection is the process of choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) that can best learn the patterns from the data and make accurate predictions on unseen (test) data. Different algorithms work better for different types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear models work well when the relationship between features and target is mostly linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tree-based models perform better when the data has non-linear relationships or complex interactions between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regularized models help avoid overfitting, especially with many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right models increases prediction accuracy, ensures good generalization to new data, and improves interpretability.\n",
